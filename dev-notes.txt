# document-hello-world-docker-test
A hello world app which generates random documents users can transfer them

TODO: merge README and dev-notes then clean up.

Dockerfile ref:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images

Dockerfile goal:
1 - install node
1.5? npm install
2 - install mongodb
3 - conduct a unit test where you make 2 users, 2 docs, and switch owners
4 - launch on web where u can make more owners and docs and switch owners


objective: A React + Redux app where you create an abstract item (maybe a task object a la Jira)
There are users which can be assigned to the tasks and they can be transfered, edited, etc.
Data is persisted in Mongo and deployed via Dockerfile (using codefresh atm)

React + Redux seed:

- MERN seed 2 looks good but Mongo must be installed prior to running. Installing Mongo "Current Stable Release (3.4.2)"
 - It says version: for Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit, .msi file
 - per this dude, that's OK for Windows 10 as well: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Mongo-Database-setup-on-6963f46f
 - Installed fine but not on PATH. I had to add this to PATH:
    - C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
    - some PATH help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7tDp0wUqvs
    - be sure to edit system PATH not user PATH / env variables
    - now run 'mongo' and you get version info! success, it's in CLI
    - received an error on npm start, noticed it's bc i need to start mongod:
Error: MongoError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect [MongoError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]
solution, per PATH help above and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13312358/mongo-couldnt-connect-to-server-127-0-0-127017
    - create folder \data\db under MongoDB installation folder, sibling of bin folder
    - run mongod --dbpath C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\data\db
    - REAL FIX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20796714/how-do-i-start-mongo-db-from-windows
    - plus a GUI tool...neato

  - now just `npm start`! visit localhost:8000

  - Installed Studio 3T non-commercial/free/core as a Mongo GUI
  - added react dev tools extension to chrome
