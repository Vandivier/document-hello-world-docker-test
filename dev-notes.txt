# document-hello-world-docker-test
A hello world app which generates random documents users can transfer them

TODO: merge README and dev-notes then clean up.

Dockerfile ref:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images

Dockerfile goal:
1 - install node
1.5? npm install
2 - install mongodb
3 - conduct a unit test where you make 2 users, 2 docs, and switch owners
4 - launch on web where u can make more owners and docs and switch owners


objective: A React + Redux app where you create an abstract item (maybe a task object a la Jira)
There are users which can be assigned to the tasks and they can be transfered, edited, etc.
Data is persisted in Mongo and deployed via Dockerfile (using codefresh atm)

React + Redux seed:

- MERN seed 2 looks good but Mongo must be installed prior to running. Installing Mongo "Current Stable Release (3.4.2)"
 - It says version: for Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit, .msi file
 - per this dude, that's OK for Windows 10 as well: https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Mongo-Database-setup-on-6963f46f
 - Installed fine but not on PATH. I had to add this to PATH:
    - C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
    - some PATH help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7tDp0wUqvs
    - be sure to edit system PATH not user PATH / env variables
    - now run 'mongo' and you get version info! success, it's in CLI
    - received an error on npm start, noticed it's bc i need to start mongod:
Error: MongoError: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect [MongoError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]
solution, per PATH help above and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13312358/mongo-couldnt-connect-to-server-127-0-0-127017
    - create folder \data\db under MongoDB installation folder, sibling of bin folder
    - run mongod --dbpath C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\data\db
    - REAL FIX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20796714/how-do-i-start-mongo-db-from-windows
    - plus a GUI tool...neato

  - now just `npm start`! visit localhost:8000

  - Installed Studio 3T non-commercial/free/core as a Mongo GUI
  - added react dev tools extension to chrome

3/28: adopting features-as-modules architecture
https://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/
http://engineering.kapost.com/2016/01/organizing-large-react-applications/

4/3
  - the weird style syntax is bc the app uses CSS Modules + React.
  - https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules
  - See Jake Trent's Pluralsight Course "Styling React Components" for a good overview.
  - the app also uses PostCss, which is neato

4/9
  - organization is a bit outdated; once stable upgrade to react-redux-router v5.0^
    - some cool boilerplates from Google or here https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#starter-kits
    - or, a 2017 article: https://habd.as/awesome-react-boilerplates/
    - top 3:
      - uses react-router-redux, from Cory House - https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/blob/master/package.json
      - leading redux kit, no react-router-redux yet, fractal architecture/Application Structure - https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit
      - leading react kit, no redux, feature-first application structure - https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate
      - I like the react-boilerplate structure most
  - react login flow: https://github.com/mxstbr/login-flow
  - check out DevTools extension http://extension.remotedev.io/ per https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit
  - containers are data containers; they are the data context for a component
    - two features may use a generic container to render different components; so it is a different layer
    - this makes containers top-level components; features actually extend or inherent some container
    - but, we still call them containers not just components to point out they are special and have no parents other than store
    - dumb components don't need containers; /public-subcomponents are all dumb bc smart top level would be a /container
    - but, there are /private-dumb-subcomponents and /private-smart-subcomponents
